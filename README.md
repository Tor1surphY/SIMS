# SIMY
A student information management system coded by C for practicing

There are a uncompleted functions that I want to add:
* Account system

accounts separated as managers which can modify and search all the student's record and students which can only search their own record without modifying.

A few bugs that I now:

If you add new record ending with double "\n", then you will find a new record as 0, so you will see the no. of students does not match thier record as they would be.

Will optimize futher.
